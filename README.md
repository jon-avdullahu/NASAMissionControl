# NASA Mission Control

## About

This project's purpose is to show how requests work on the back-end side of a project,
in this case I used Postman to test out the API written by requesting (POST / GET / UPDATE) Requests that, if functional, will be integrated into the Web App.
And the API is fully functional, so I have integrated it into the Web App.

## Installation

Use "npm install" to install the packages needed in order to run this code successfully. (run this in these folders: (client, server, and root directory).


```bash
npm install
npm install -g nodemon            <-- (if "nodemon" is not installed) 
```

(You may install Postman if you want to individually test out requests, but not needed necessarily).




## Usage

```bash
To use this application (after installation):



1.CD to the directory of the project and run "npm run deploy"

2.A localhost will be ran with the port 8000, and you open it through the browser.

If everything was installed as mentioned above, you should be able to see the NASA Mission Control Webpage, with fully functional Launches and History.
